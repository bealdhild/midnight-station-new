  # Role Types

  ## Crew-aligned 
  Crew-aligned people are non-antagonists that are mindshielded. They are supposed to help out the station overall and defend it as best they can against threats.

  ## Non-antagonist 
  The vast majority of players in a normal game, expected to act as a somewhat-reasonable person and avoid working directly against the crew or with those that are.

  ## Free agent
  Free agents are supposed to pursue their own agenda, avoid mass destruction and follow escalation rules. To antagonize or help the crew is their choice to make.

  ## Minor Antag
  Minor antags are expected to act towards their goals without stealing the show. Usually they are rolled in addition to other antags.

  ## Moderate Antag
  Moderate Antags must actively oppose the crew to achieve their objectives. They are not allowed to cause massive destruction under normal circumstances, but are also expected to continue causing problems after completing their objectives.

  ## Major antag
  Major antags are existential threats to the station, and on occasion all of realspace. They are allowed to do whatever they must as long as it does not work against their objective.

  ## Familiar
  Familiars are considered non-antagonists, but have instructions to obey someone. They must obey this person even if it causes them to violate roleplay rules or die. You are only a familiar if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a familiar. You are only the familiar of the person the game tells you.

  ## Silicon / Altered Silicon
  Silicons have a set of laws that they must follow above all else except the core rules. You are only silicon if the game clearly and explicitly tells you that you are a silicon.
  Altered Silicons are functionally identical, this role is used to highlight law-sets that have been hacked, corrupted or are otherwise considered non-standard or dangerous.
