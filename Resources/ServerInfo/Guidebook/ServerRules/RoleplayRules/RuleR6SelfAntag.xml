  # Roleplay Rule 6 - Don't act like an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are one
  Acting like an antagonist when you are not one is often referred to as "self-antagging" or being a "self-antag", both of these things are against the rules. You are not an antagonist unless the game tells you that you are an antagonist. Do not make yourself a major problem, annoyance, or disruption while not an antagonist. Do not willfully cooperate with known antagonists. This does not mean that you cannot be involved in conflict, or even start conflict as per escalation.

  ## Exemptions
  Self-antagonism is allowed if you get a DEBUG or ADMEME weapon. A chinalake, a python, etc. doesn't count. A gibstick does, for example. Other exceptions you may ask the admin for, but if you doubt it's fine, then it's probably not.

  ## Examples
  These examples assume that you are not an antagonist.

  Acceptable:
  - Stealing or breaking a glass from the bar.
  - Replacing someone's shoes with clown shoes.
  - Running to avoid arrest.
  - Conflicts following escalation.
  - Giving everyone all access during war ops. (This is not necessarily a good idea)

  Prohibited:
  - Low-effort or low-roleplay gatherings to disrupt the round (IC revolutions or cults that have no development or make no sense).
  - Mutinying the captain because they didn't give you want you wanted.
  - Killing a security officer to avoid arrest.
  - Randomly smashing lots of station lights.
  - Disrupting station power without a good reason.
  - Spacing parts of the station without a good reason.
  - Distributing significant levels of access without a good reason.
  - Stealing high risk or high value items, like the nuclear authentication disk, for no reason.
